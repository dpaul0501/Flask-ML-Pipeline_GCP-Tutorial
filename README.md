# For this In-Class assignment you will deploy an ML-based Flask app first on local host and then host it on GCP using a continuous pipeline.

## Flask ML Model CD Pipeline Tutorial
The data set in this exercise is from the blog on Flask Tutorial at [Build the first Flask Python web app framework](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/https-medium-com-chirag6891-build-the-first-flask-python-e278b52473f3). This codebase is based on the GCP Pipeline tutorial at [ML Deployment on Cloud](https://github.com/jgvaraujo/ml-deployment-on-gcloud)

## ML Model Flask-Deployment
This project demonstrates how a Flask ML app can be deployed on Google Cloud Platform using Docker container and YAML files that are useful to build continuous deployment (CD) pipelines. 

### Prerequisites (requirements.txt)
 - Scikit Learn
 - Pandas 
 - Numpy
 - Flask 

### Steps for the Assignment

#### Make sure you are using the (In-Class-assignment) branch and not the main branch

#### On you LOCAL Device (Laptop)
All the application files are contained in the folder 'app_files'. The goal is to build an ML model using Decision Tree Classifier. Start by cloning the repo to your local drive.
- Step 1: Inside folder 'app_files' open the code 'model.py'. **Add some lines there to train a regression model (ANY regression model)**. Run 'model.py' so the 'treemodel.pkl' gets created.
- Step 2: Run: python app.py. Check out the localhost app. It should work properly. Take a snapshot of the URL and your app. If not please do necessary debugging.

#### To be done on GCP
Make sure your instructor has given all the necessary GCP Permission. An important part of the assignment is also to learn to parse the logs and understand permission errors or debug any coding error for which build might fail or not get triggered. 

Let's continute with Cloud Deployment
- Step 3: Now, fork the Github: https://github.com/dpaul0501/Flask-ML-Pipeline_GCP-Tutorial/tree/main to your Github account. This is important for the CD pipeline that we will build. Make sure you are using the (In-Class-assignment) branch.
- Step 4: Go to the page https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=fb-mle-feb-22 and create a PUSH trigger using Dockerfile for your forked github project page (Folow instructions shown in class). RUN the trigger and check logs. This step will not deploy the app
- Step 5: Repeat Step 4 but use YAML as your source. In the YAML append your name to the name of the app appropriately by appending your last name for eg. flaskappmlpaul  (marked with comment in cloudbuild.yaml) (Line 29). RUN the trigger and check the app. Check the cloud Build on https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers?project=fb-mle-feb-22
- Step 6: Take a picture of your app with the sample URL (https://console.developers.google.com/run?project=fb-mle-feb-22). SUBMIT THIS PICTURE FOR YOUR ASSIGNMENT. Also add a snaptshot with the input feature and predicted output you got from querying the model using request.py. Please note an app deployed on GCP might not automatically be exposed to any user on the internet. It is usually exposed to project owner and other principles (who has necessary permission). Make sure your app is accessable to all users. Ideally the argument of cloudbuild.yml should make the app accessible to all users, but sometime it might not happen.
-  To add permission to all user, go to permissions tab in the app **(Principal: allUsers, Role:Cloud Run Invoker)**
-  Now try the url in any browser to see the application working via an UI. Also download the request.py from the same branch and update the url and run it to query the api, without an UI. This is similar to what we did in week 13 google vision api project)
- 
#### Now you have uploaded your OWN ML app on GCP with a CD Pipeline! Congratulations..
- Step 7: Clean up. Please DELETE your Triggers and your ML app before you go. Make sure you have delete permission (Often app deletion is not given to MLE/scientistis and needs to be seeked)

### Things to notice
The local flask app will run on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (localhost). This is because the GCP app is detected on this port only. This step is native to GCP deployment only.
